	Unit Disc Cover (UDC) problem asks for the minimal number of unit disks covering a given set of points and the placements of these circles.

	The problem is proved to be NP-hard; however, there exist plenty of polynomial and pseudopolynomial approximation algorithms solving it.

	The authors implement several known algorithms for UDC and compare their efficiency. They also present a new 7-approximation algorithm running in linear time on average and two heuristics that help speed it up.

	The algorithm devised by the authors covers the query set with circles aligned to the sqrt(2)-sized grid. Then it is proved that the algorithm outputs not more than seven times the number of circles contained in the optimal answer.

	The authors conclude that the algorithm by Liu and Lu (2014) is optimal for practical applications, yet their algorithm overperforms it in certain cases.
