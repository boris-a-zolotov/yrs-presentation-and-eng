Even though we think everything is controlled by our consciousness, our unconsciousness is responsible for much more things that we expect. For example, to cope with enormous amounts of information flowing around us we need to come up with shortcuts that help us find main points more quickly and easily. Those shortcuts are stored in our subconscious, and stereotypes are a form of them. 

We are subject to lots of different biases that are hard to acknowledge. What is more, we often lack precise arguments to support the points that we find commonly believed. This is where the so-called confirmation bias is showed best: searching through arrays of data people are prone to find the pieces that support their, often controversial, claims; and their opponents, even though they share a more common point of view, can not support it enough because they never had to argue on it previously.
