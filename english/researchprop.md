Voronoi diagram — subdivision of a metric space into areas corresponding to _n_ points called sites, such that every point in the space belongs to the area of the closest of the sites.

PCB — metric space consisting of multiple layers, where length of a path is determined by its overall length, the number of transitions between layers, and the number of turns, where only 45° turns are allowed.

Multicriterion optimisation problem — a problem of finding a solution optimal with respect to several criteria taken with different weights.
