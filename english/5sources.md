Geometric Folding Algorithms
--------
### `bachelors-thesis/misc/papers/`

The book covers the whole field that studies nets and foldings of polytopes. It recaps all the articles published in this field to present its up-to-date state in the most complete fashion. The book examines if it is possible to reconstruct a polyhedron given the collection of polygons it is glued from; it describes which configuration of polygons produce which polyhedra and how many ways there are to glue a given configuration of polygons into a polyhedron. It also covers different known ways of folding and gluing that are of use and importance in the field.

The book is equipped with comprehensive illustrative material and in-depth explanations and is recommended for anyone willing to pursue the study of foldings and computational geometry in general.

Incremental Voronoi diagrams
--------
### `arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08485.pdf/`

The article studies combinatorial changes that a Voronoi Diagram for _n_ sites undergoes when a new site is inserted. First, it introduces the _flarb_ which is the operation that embodies all the changes — deletions and insertions of edges — that happen to the graph of the diagram. The flarb is, to simplify, deletion of all the edges of the graph inside the given curve and adding to the graph all the edges along this curve.

Then the article proves a very important bound: it turns out that there is only _O_(`sqrt`(_n_)) combinatorial changes in the graph per flarb, if several flarbs are applied consequtively. The proof is carried out by introducing a potential function. This bound is of huge importance for the study of dynamic Voronoi diagrams. The article is recommended for anyone pursuing them.

Shortest Paths on a Polyhedron

_a. k. a. **«Chen—Han's Algortihm»**_

There are several algorithms that allow for efficient search for shortest geodesic paths between points on a given polyhedral surface. This article presents the fastest of them. The algorithm is based on what resembles depth first search aided by «one angle — one split» principle that bounds the size of the tree generated by the search.

The algorithm is rather easy to understand and feasible to implement. It also has many applications in later pieces of research. The article is recommended for those studying geometrical algorithms.
