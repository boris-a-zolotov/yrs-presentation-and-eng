ABSTRACT
	The support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful tool in machine learning. It operates by separating the points of a dataset by a surface, and then assigning a class to a point depending on its position relative to this surface.

	A basic SVM utilizes a hyperplane such that the margins between it and the boundaries of the classes are the widest possible. If the classes are not linearly separable, the translation to a space of a higher dimension or the introduction of slack variables reflecting the training error are used. The SVM also can be generalized to treat more than two classes.

	The authors present two methods to find the optimal separating surface. Both methods are based on applying an evolutionary algorithm that would approximate the coefficients defining the surface.
