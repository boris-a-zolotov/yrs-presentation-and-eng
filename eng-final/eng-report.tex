{\large \bf Alexandrov's Theorem}

Is always brought up when it comes to gluing things. \medskip

If a gluing is homeomorphic to a sphere \\
and the sum of angles at each of \\
its vertices is $\le 360^\circ$\!, there $\exists\,!$ convex \\
polyhedron that corresponds to this gluing.

{\large \bf Folding a single polygon}

As we can see from the previous example, \\
a single polygon can be glued to itself, \\
the same conditions remain. \medskip \\
We will be {\it only} considering \\
foldability to {\it convex} polyhedra.

{\large \bf A not-foldable polygon}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=3cm]{minilec/notf}
\end{center} \vspace{-5mm}

Consider where the reflex vertex can be glued?..

{\large \bf Foldability of random polygons}

No matter how «a random polygon» is sampled, \\
we are expecting that it: \vspace{-4mm}

\begin{itemize}
	\item has at least two reflex vertices on average,
	\item the edge lengths are drawn from a \\
	cont. density distribution.
\end{itemize} \vspace{-4mm}

The probability that a random $n$-gon can be folded into a convex polyhedron approaches 0 as \(n \to \infty\).

{\large \bf Perimeter-halving}

{\it Any convex} polygon can be folded into \\
a convex polyhedron by {\it perimeter halving.}

By varying the points half a perimeter apart we get \\
uncountably many {\it incongruent} polyhedra.

{\large \bf Edge-to-edge folding}

Let us consider the subcase when entire edges \\
must be glued to entire edges.

There is a dynamic programming algorithm \\
to list all the gluings.

{\large \bf Dynamic programming}

Idea: find a pair of matching edges, check angles, \\
reduce to two subproblems.

{\large \bf All e2e gluings of the Latin cross}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{minilec/latincross}
\end{center}

{\large \bf General algorithm} \vspace{-2mm}

There is also an algorithm that lists {\it all} the foldings; \\
it has exponential running time. \vspace{-5mm}

{\large \bf Gluing tree} \vspace{-3mm}

Shows how the boundary of a folded polygon \\
corresponds to itself.\quad How to find the vertices \\
of the polyhedron by looking at \\
the vertices of the gluing tree?

{\large \bf Analyse the curvature}

\end{center}

{\large \bf Rolling belt}

A path in the gluing tree that: \vspace{-5mm}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Connects two leaves of the gluing tree \\
		that are either convex-vertex or \\
		fold-point leaves (positive deficit),
	\item The face angle to each side of the path is, \\
		at every point, convex.
\end{itemize}

{\large \bf Rolling belts: examples}

Half of perimeter of any convex polygon or

	\includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{minilec/gtreerb}
\end{center}

{\large \bf Gluing tree properties} \vspace{-5mm}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-3mm]
	\item Each leaf is either a vertex of the polygon, \\ or a fold point.
	\item At most one nonvertex may be glued at any \\ gluing-tree junction of degree \(d \ge 3\).
	\item A gluing tree may have at most two rolling belts \\ with distinct endpoints.
	\item The case of four fold-point leaves is possible \\ only under special circumstances.
\end{itemize}

{\large \bf Rectangle with two rolling belts}

{\large \bf Exponential number of gluing trees} \vspace{-2mm}

For any even \(n\), there is a polygon \(P\) of \(n\) vertices \\
that has \(2^{Ω(n)}\) combinatorially distinct \\
edge-to-edge Alexandrov gluings. \vspace{-2mm}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=5.1cm]{minilec/stargt}
\end{center}

{\large \bf Contracted gluing trees}

There is the default gluing tree, it can be contracted in an exponential number of ways to form new trees.
